      description: |-
        This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see
        the balance currently on your Stripe account.

        You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of
        [transactions](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance
        (charges, payouts, and so forth).

        The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by
        payment source types.

            be `eur`. Suppose this was converted into 12.34 USD in your Stripe account.
            Then the BalanceTransaction's `amount` would be `1234`, `currency` would

        <p>You can create coupons easily via the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons">coupon management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.</p>

        <p>A coupon has either a <code>percent_off</code> or an <code>amount_off</code> and <code>currency</code>. If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency> will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it.</p>

        <p>Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. For a <code>status=open</code> invoice, a credit note reduces
        its <code>amount_due</code>. For a <code>status=paid</code> invoice, a credit note does not affect its <code>amount_due</code>. Instead, it can result
        in any combination of the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Refund: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or link an existing refund (using <code>refund</code>).</li>
        <li>Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.</li>
        <li>Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using <code>out_of_band_amount</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.</p>

        <p>You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note will increment the invoice’s <code>pre_payment_credit_notes_amount</code>
        or <code>post_payment_credit_notes_amount</code> depending on its <code>status</code> at the time of credit note creation.</p>

For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the <strong>source</strong> parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the <strong>default_source</strong> for a customer will not trigger this behavior.</p>

        <p>When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best first step. If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes">dashboard</a>, but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>

        <p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our <a href="/docs/disputes/categories">guide to dispute types</a>.</p>

        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.</p>

        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice resource.</p>

        <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a>
        or a PaymentIntent with <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>.
        These approaches will perform any necessary steps to ensure that the PaymentMethod can be used in a future payment. Using the
        <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code> endpoint does not ensure that future payments can be made with the attached PaymentMethod.
        See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up future payments.</p>

        <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments,
        set <a href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>,
        on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

        <p>Creates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a quantity.</p>

        <p>Usage records provide <code>quantity</code> information that Stripe uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage information and the pricing model set up by the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing">metered billing</a> plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.</p>

        <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href="/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the <code>action</code> parameter.</p>

        <p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a href="/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme">per-unit pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers">tiered pricing</a> model.</p>

                  description: |-
                    Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

                    `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.

        <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

        <code>enabled_events</code>. You may optionally specify the Boolean <code>connect</code>
        parameter. If set to true, then a Connect webhook endpoint that notifies the
        specified <code>url</code> about events from all connected accounts is created;
        otherwise an account webhook endpoint that notifies the specified <code>url</code>
        only about events from your account is created. You can also create webhook
        endpoints in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks">webhooks
